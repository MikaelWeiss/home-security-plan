This is the beginning of a defense in depth plan for a home network. The plan will include a network diagram, a list of devices, and a list of security measures to be implemented. The plan will be implemented in three parts. The first part will be the creation of a home network security plan. The second part will be the implementation of defense in depth tactics. The third part will be the improvement of the security of the home network. Each part will take two hours to complete.
